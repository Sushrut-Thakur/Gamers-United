							<h4><strong>Processor</strong></h4>
							<p>
								The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is what makes your computer run. The CPU routes instructions from one system in your computer to another. The better the processor, the faster it can transmit information for both software and hardware functions.

							<h4><strong>Motherboard</strong></h4>
							<p>
								The motherboard is where all the hardware in your computer lives. The most important thing about a motherboard is its compatibility with the parts you choose. Motherboards can also have integrated graphics cards, Wi-Fi systems and more.

							<h4><strong>Graphics Card</strong></h4>
							<p>
								Arguably the most important component in a gaming rig, the GPU (graphics processing unit) renders images from your PC and puts them on your monitor. More powerful GPUs facilitate better in-game graphics and settings.

							<h4><strong>RAM</strong></h4>
							<p>
								RAM (Random Access Memory) determines how much data your computer can process at any given moment. To oversimplify things considerably, RAM is where your computer stores information it needs to access right away. The more RAM you have, the more efficiently your computer can process lots of information — helpful for productivity; essential for games.

							<h4><strong>Power Supply</strong></h4>
							<p>
								Possibly the least interesting and most vital piece of the PC puzzle, the PSU (Power Supply Unit) is exactly what it sounds like: It gets electricity from an outlet to individual systems in your computer. Picking the right one can be tricky, but once you do, you’ll probably never need to think about it again.

							<h4><strong>Storage</strong></h4>
							<p>
								PC storage essentially comes in two flavors: Solid state drives (SSDs) and hard disk drives (HDDs). Either way, it’s where your files live when they’re not in use. Faster the storage, lower the loading times. SSDs are fast and HDDs are big, so make sure to get the best of both worlds.
